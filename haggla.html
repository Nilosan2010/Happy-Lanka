Hakgala Botanical(Haggala Botanical Garden) Garden is one of the five botanical gardens in Sri Lanka. 
The other four are Peradeniya Botanical Garden, Henarathgoda Botanical Garden, Mirijjawila Botanical Garden and Seetawaka Botanical Garden. 
It is the second largest botanical garden in Sri Lanka. 
The garden is contiguous to Hakgala Strict Nature Reserve.
<br>
Hakgala Botanical Garden is situated on the Nuwara Eliya-Badulla main road, 16 km from Nuwara Eliya and extends for about 28 hectares. 
The garden has a cool temperate climate because its altitude is 5,500 feet above sea level. 
The mean annual temperature ranges between 16 °C to 30 °C during the course of a year. 
From December to February, it has a cold climate, while the warm climate persists from April to August.

The garden was established in 1861, under George Henry Kendrick Thwaites as an experimental cultivation of cinchona, a commercial crop thriving at the time. 
Once after tea replaced the cinchona, it was turned into an experimental tea cultivation. 
In 1884 it transformed into a garden. 
Since then many subtropical and some temperate plants have been planted in the gardens.
<br>
In Hindu mythology, it says that the Lankan King Ravana, after abducting Sita, kept her hidden in this area, and the area was offered to Sita as a pleasure garden. 
The place finds mention in the Ramayana as Ashok Vatika.[citation needed] The area was named "Sita Eliya," and "Sita Amman Temple" was built on the site.
