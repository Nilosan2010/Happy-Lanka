Sri Dalada Maligawa, commonly known in English as the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, 
is a Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the Royal Palace Complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, 
which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, 
the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. 
The relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings. The Temple of the Tooth is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the temple and the relic.
<br>
Bhikkhus of the two particular chapters, the Malwathu chapters and Asgiri chapters, 
conduct daily worship in the inner chamber of the temple. Rituals are performed three times daily: at dawn, 
at noon and in the evenings. On Wednesdays, 
there is a symbolic bathing of the relic with a herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya; 
this holy water is believed to contain healing powers and is distributed to those present. The Kandy Esala Perahera, 
is conducted annually to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic.
<br>
After the Maha parinirvana of Gautama Buddha, according to the legend, 
the tooth relic was preserved in Kalinga and smuggled to the island by Princess Hemamali and her husband, 
Prince Dantha on the instructions of her father King Guhasiva. Hemmamali hid the relic in her hair on the way to the island. 
They landed on the island in Lankapattana during the reign of Sirimeghavanna of Anuradhapura (301â€“328) and handed over the tooth relic. 
The king enshrined it in Meghagiri Vihara (present day Isurumuniya) in Anuradhapura. Safeguarding the relic was the responsibility of the monarch from then, 
therefore over the years, the custodianship of the relic came to symbolize the right to rule the island. Therefore, 
reigning monarchs built the tooth relic temples quite close to their royal residences, as was the case during the times of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, 
Kingdom of Polonnaruwa, and Kingdom of Dambadeniya. During the era of the Kingdom of Gampola, the relic was housed in Niyamgampaya Vihara. 
It is reported in the messenger poems such as Hamsa, Gira, 
and Selalihini that the temple of tooth relic was situated within the city of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte when the Kingdom of Kotte was established there.
